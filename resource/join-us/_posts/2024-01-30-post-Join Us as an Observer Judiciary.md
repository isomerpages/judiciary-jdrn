<p>The Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) process refers to the proactive,
judge-led management of cases, twinned with the use of a range of Court
Alternative Dispute Resolution modalities to achieve the resolution of
court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved.</p>
<p>A court or judiciary which is interested in learning about and adopting
the JDR process and in participating in the activities of the JDRN may
apply to join the JDRN as an Observer (Judiciary).</p>
