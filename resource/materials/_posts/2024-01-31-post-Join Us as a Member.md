<p>The Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) process refers to the proactive,
judge-led management of cases, twinned with the use of a range of Court
Alternative Dispute Resolution modalities to achieve the resolution of
court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved.</p>
<p>A court or judiciary which has experience in the JDR process and has integrated
it into its judicial process as a key component of case management may
apply for membership of the JDRN.</p>
