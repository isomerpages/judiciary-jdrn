The Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) process refers to the proactive, judge-led management of cases, twinned with the use of a range of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution modalities to achieve the resolution of court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved.

A court or judiciary which is interested in learning about and adopting the JDR process and in participating in the activities of the JDRN may apply to join the JDRN as an Observer (Judiciary).

Please complete this form and send to: [JDRN\_SECRETARIAT@judiciary.gov.sg](mailto:JDRN_SECRETARIAT@judiciary.gov.sg).
