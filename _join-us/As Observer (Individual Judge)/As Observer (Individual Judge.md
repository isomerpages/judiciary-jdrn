 The Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) process refers to the proactive, judge-led management of cases, twinned with the use of a range of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution modalities to achieve the resolution of court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved.

A judge of a court or judiciary who is interested in learning about the JDR process and in participating in the activities of the JDRN may apply to join the JDRN as an Observer (Individual Judge).
