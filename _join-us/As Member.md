The Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) process refers to the proactive, judge-led management of cases, twinned with the use of a range of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution modalities to achieve the resolution of court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved.

A court or judiciary which has experience in the JDR process and has integrated it into its judicial process as a key component of case management may apply for membership of the JDRN.
