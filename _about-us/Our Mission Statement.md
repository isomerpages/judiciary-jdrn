<p><strong><u>Promoting the early, amicable resolution of cases through judge-led case management and Court ADR modalities.</u></strong>
</p>
<p><u>Description</u>
</p>
<p>The mission of the International Judicial Dispute Resolution Network (“JDRN”)
is to advance the adoption of the Judicial Dispute Resolution (“JDR”) process
in judicial systems around the world to enhance the administration and
delivery of justice by promoting the early, amicable, cost-effective and
fair resolution of court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time
is saved through pro-active, judge-led management of cases, coupled with
the employment of the whole suite of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution
(“ADR”) modalities such as (a) early neutral evaluation, (b) mediation,
(c) judge-facilitated negotiations, and (d) the appointment of assessors
/ experts / referees / third-party mediators to help determine complex
factual issues, as a core case management strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The JDRN is a non-binding and voluntary group of like-minded judiciaries
which collectively seek to pursue the vision, mission, objectives and goals
of the Network.</p>
