The mission of the JDRN is to advance the adoption of the Judicial Dispute Resolution (“JDR”) process in judicial systems around the world to enhance the administration and delivery of justice by promoting the early, amicable, cost-effective and fair resolution of court disputes in full or in part so that judicial time is saved through pro-active, judge-led management of cases, coupled with the employment  of the whole suite of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) modalities such as (a) early neutral evaluation, (b) mediation, (c) judge-facilitated negotiations, and (d) the appointment of assessors / experts / referees to help determine complex factual issues, as a core case management strategy.
