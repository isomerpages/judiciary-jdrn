The mission of the JDRN is to promote the adoption of judicial dispute resolution (“JDR”) around the world to help enhance the administration of justice by enabling the early, amicable and fair resolution of court disputes without the need for a trial through the use of the whole suite of judge-led JDR modalities such as (a) judicial mediation, (b) early neutral evaluation and (c) judge-directed negotiations as a core case management strategy.
