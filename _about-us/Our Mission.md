The mission of the JDRN is to advance the adoption of the Judicial Dispute Resolution (“JDR”) process in judicial systems around the world to enhance the administration and delivery of justice by promoting the early, amicable, cost-effective and fair resolution of court disputes without the need for a trial through pro-active, judge-led management of cases, twinned with the employment of Court Alternative Dispute Resolution (“ADR”) modalities.
