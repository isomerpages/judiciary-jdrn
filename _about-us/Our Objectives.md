<p>The objectives of the JDRN are to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide
a platform for member judiciaries of the JDRN and other interested judiciaries
to share experiences and exchange ideas and expertise on leveraging the
JDR process to manage their cases effectively and achieve better outcomes
for litigants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop
and promote a set of standards and best practices to serve as the benchmark
for the development and practice of the JDR process in jurisdictions which
are keen to institutionalise it in their judicial systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Support efforts in judicial systems which are interested in adopting the
JDR process by providing access to knowhow and resources for capacity building
and the development of judicial competencies in the JDR process.</p>
