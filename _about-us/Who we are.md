Formed in March 2022, the International JDRN is an international network of judiciaries working together to promote the early resolution of disputes by judge-led dispute resolution processes. 

The trial process and the process of getting to trial is long and expensive. Poorer litigants and litigants with smaller value claims are not well served by a judicial system that requires that they go to trial.

We are a group of judiciaries that have seen the value in offering litigants alternatives to trials for dispute resolution and are working together to promote the wider use of these other modalities.
